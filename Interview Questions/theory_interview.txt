### What is worker Thread? 
-> A Worker Thread is background thread whose job is to execute tasks assigned to it, instead of creating a new Thread for the each task.
A worker thread waits for work → executes the work → waits again
It does not die after one task. It is reused.

==== Scenario: Restaurant kitchen ====
Orders = tasks
Chefs = worker threads

❌ Bad approach:
Hire a new chef for every order

✅ Good approach:
Fixed number of chefs
Orders go to a queue
Free chef picks next order
That chef is a worker thread.

import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class WorkerThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor =
                Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2); // 2 worker threads
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            int taskId = i;
            executor.submit(() -> {
                System.out.println(
                    "Task " + taskId +
                    " executed by " +
                    Thread.currentThread().getName()
                );
            });
        }
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
======= output ====
Task 1 executed by pool-1-thread-1
Task 2 executed by pool-1-thread-2
Task 3 executed by pool-1-thread-1
Task 4 executed by pool-1-thread-2
Task 5 executed by pool-1-thread-1

### What is try-with-resource
Try-with-resources is a Java feature (introduced in Java 7) used to automatically close resources such as:
Files , Database connections ,Streams , Sockets
It ensures that resources are closed properly, even if an exception occurs.
In short:- 
You open a resource → use it → Java closes it automatically

### Why was try-with-resources introduced?
Before this feature, developers had to close resources manually inside a finally block.

Problems with old approach:
Easy to forget closing
Code becomes long and messy
Risk of resource leaks
Exception inside finally could hide original exception
Try-with-resources solves all these problems.

Scenario: Borrowing a book from a library
~~ Old way (without try-with-resources)
You borrow a book. You must remember to return it, If something goes wrong, you may forget to return it.

~~ New way (try-with-resources)
Library system auto-returns the book. Even if something goes wrong No chance of forgetting.
